# Sports timing system

Sports timing system is an arduino based project for mesauring time in different sports (mainly focused at alpine snowboard in skis).
The system is made up by two parts
 * hardware - arduino based start and finish with a code to power it all, it is capable of running alone
 * desktop app - to extend the functionality the app provides easy controls over the system, like saving many results from the training/competition in excel format

Whole project is free to use and modify.
